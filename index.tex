\section{Introduction}

I started writing this text in September 2021, several decades well after \sed
was invented, yet even though there were a few books among other resources
providing introductions and lists of use cases where \sed is still a relatively
good idea in the context of a simple shell script.  Here we have another goal,
to explore this tool as an esoteric programming language, trying to exploit it
in order to achive uses way outside its imagined scope when it was created.

\todo{Write about resources to start with sed, including the standard}

\todo{Write about sed memory, maybe in another section?}

\section{Languages}

In this section we will provide the set of definitions from Language Theory
used in this text.  This is only done in order to have a common language.
