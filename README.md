# advanced-sed
A project to build a book about advanced sed.

Draft versions can be seen here: https://github.com/fcr--/advanced-sed/actions/workflows/build-pdf.yml?query=is%3Asuccess+branch%3Amaster, inside each github-actions execution there is a PDF artifact, that when clicked downloads a zip with that version of the pdf.  Those versions don't contain the TODO list, as I wasn't able to build it with the latex version used at the build (while maintaining compatibility with really old latex2e distributions).
